      <br>
       <h2><li>Red Blood Cells</h2> These cells carry oxygen throughout the body and are often used in treatments for anemia, surgery, trauma, cancer, and diseases of the blood.</li>
      <br>
      <h2><li>Plasma</h2> This is the liquid part of the blood that carries cells and proteins throughout the body. It is used in treatments for burn victims, shock, and patients with clotting disorders.</li>
      <br>
